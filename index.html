ACM-W is an organization that is a part of ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery. ACM-W is an active, international organization that “supports, celebrates, and advocates for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field”. Thus, not only are we a well-known presence here at the university of women supporting women, but we are part of an international computing community of women supporting us and other women as well.<br><br>Women in Technology (WiT) is dedicated to supporting, engaging and empowering women in STEM. The mission of WIT is to aid in the growth and development of women, to create a strong, inclusive community of women in technology, and to provide opportunities for academic and professional success. WiT holds a strong presence here in the Computer Science community at the University of San Francisco. Every week, we hold meetings, social events, workshops, panels, or talks. We create a safe, welcoming space for young women to feel comfortable and a part of the computing community because it can be an overwhelming environment in many ways.</p>
